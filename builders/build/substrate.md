# Basic Substrate {: #basic-substrate } 

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Substrate is a software development kit (SDK) for building blockchains. This framework is the foundation and engine powering the Polkadot's relay chain, the parachains (such as the Tanssi network), and also the ContainerChains deployed through Tanssi. 

Written in the Rust Language, and designed with a modular architecture, Substrate is extremely performant, flexible and highly customizable, making it the best choice to develop blockchains.

In this article, key features of Substrate are explained:
